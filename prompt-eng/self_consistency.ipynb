    "# Self Consistency Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more advanced techniques in prompt engineering is self-consistency, introduced by `Wang et al. (2022)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method seeks to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding typically used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT and leveraging these variations to determine the most consistent answer. The technique  enhances the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly for tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n",

      "* Users will have access to their profile information, including name, email, and study goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Message Types\n",
      "\n",
      "* Users will be able to send different types of messages to the bot, such as:\n",
      "\t+ Study requests (e.g., \"What are some notes on chapter X?\")\n",
      "\t+ Question asking (e.g., \"I'm having trouble with this question\")\n",
      "\t+ Document sharing (e.g., a PDF or image)\n",
      "* The bot will respond accordingly based on the message type.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Interaction Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "* Users will be able to navigate through different interactions, such as:\n",
      "\t+ Asking for help with a specific topic\n",
      "\t+ Requesting study materials or resources\n",
      "\t+ Sharing their own notes or documents\n",

      "* Users will be able to share their documents with the bot for analysis or review.\n",
      "* The bot will provide users with relevant insights, summaries, or suggestions based on the document content.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Content Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "* The bot will perform natural language processing (NLP) on user input to analyze sentiment, tone, and meaning.\n",
      "* The bot will use this analysis to:\n",
      "\t+ Provide personalized study recommendations\n",
      "\t+ Identify areas of improvement for users\n",
      "\t+ Offer suggestions for further learning or review\n",

      "### 3. Question Answering\n",
      "\n",
      "* The bot will have access to a vast knowledge base or database that it can draw upon to answer user questions.\n",
      "* The bot will provide accurate and relevant responses based on the question asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Study Materials Provision\n",
      "\n",
      "* The bot will be able to suggest study materials, resources, or tutorials based on user input or analysis.\n",
      "* These materials will be curated to meet the specific needs of each user.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. User Profile Management\n",
      "\n",
      "* The bot will maintain a user profile that tracks their progress, activity, and learning goals.\n",
      "* This profile will enable the bot to provide personalized recommendations and support for users over time.\n",
