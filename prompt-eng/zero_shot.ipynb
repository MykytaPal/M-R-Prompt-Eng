    "# Zero-Shot Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot prompting refers to a technique in prompt engineering where you provide a model with a task without any prior examples. The model is expected to understand and generate a response or complete the task purely based on the given instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the model is given \"zero\" prior training examples or demonstrations in the prompt and relies on its pre-trained knowledge to infer what is needed.\n",

      "**User Interactions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Document Uploads**\n",
      "\t* Users will initiate document uploads by sending a file to the bot via Discord's file sharing feature.\n",
      "\t* The bot will receive the uploaded file and process it for analysis.\n",
      "2. **Questioning and Information Retrieval**\n",
      "\t* Users will ask questions about their documents, such as querying specific information or requesting summaries.\n",
      "\t* The bot will respond with relevant answers based on its analysis of the document.\n",
      "3. **Error Notifications and Confirmations**\n",
      "\t* If a user's file is not in an acceptable format, the bot will notify them with instructions for correction.\n",
      "\t* In case of errors during processing, the bot will provide clear error messages and suggestions for resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Functionalities:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Document Handling**\n",
      "\t* Support for various file formats (e.g., PDF, Word, Excel)\n",
      "\t* Automatic document parsing and text extraction\n",
      "\t* Ability to handle large files efficiently\n",
      "2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Content Indexing**\n",
      "\t* Integration with NLP libraries for accurate content analysis\n",
      "\t* Creation of a content index for efficient search and retrieval of information\n",
      "3. **Question Processing and Answer Generation**\n",
      "\t* Support for various question formats (e.g., natural language, keyword-based)\n",
      "\t* Ability to generate answers based on the document's content and user queries\n",
      "4. **User Feedback and Error Handling**\n",
      "\t* Response validation to ensure accuracy and relevance of answers\n",
      "\t* Message formatting to provide clear and concise responses\n",
      "5. **Discord Integration**\n",
      "\t* Command processing for bot commands (e.g., upload, question)\n",
      "\t* Messaging interfaces for sending responses and notifications\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Requirements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Security and Data Protection**\n",
      "\t* Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user documents and data.\n",
      "2. **User Interface and Experience**\n",
      "\t* Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the bot.\n",
      "3. **Scalability and Performance**\n",
